# The-Gaming-Room-Software-Design-Document
1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room company wanted to create a website version of their game, "Draw It or Lose It." The game had a few different requirements. First off, it had to have the ability to have one or more teams involved in the game. Each team had to be able to hold multiple players. Game and team names needed to be unique and allow others to see if a name was already taken. And it also required that only one instance of the game was held in memory at any given point. 

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think that one part of the document that I answered well was the "Evaluation" portion. In this portion, information was provided about each operating system. This information includes the development tools these operating systems use, how clients use these operating systems, as well as server information for each. These explanations included pros and cons to each operating system.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Something that I found helpful with working through the document while developing the code was that it gave me a more in-depth understanding of how all of requirements of the company, choice of operating system, and other constraints influence the development of an application.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think that if I had to revise one part of this document, it would be the executive summary. After developing the application and understanding a little bit more about how it works, I beleive that I would be able to go more in-depth on the various topics covered in the summary. In the beginning of the class, I had to fill it out based on what I currently understood about the program. After spending some time developing it, 
there are a number of additional details that could have been included in the summary.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The requirements given to us the The Gaming Room were all specifically included in the final product to ensure that they got the product that they wanted. With that in mind, The Gaming Room had a vision for what they wanted the application to be like to their users, and its important that we follow through with that. The Gaming Room company had us create this application with these requirements knowing that it would enhace the experience for their users in the end.
If the users don't enjoy the product, they likely wouldn't end up using it.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Designing this software did prove to be a little tricky in the beginning. Whenever you begin to work on a project that already has had a large amount of coding done beforehand, it takes me a while to go through the code to understand what each part is doing and why. From there, I then have to figure out how to implement the required new code in coordination with what already exists. Something that I need to do a better job at is diagramming or mapping out the code
so that I have a continual reference for whcih each part or class does. This would help speed up the process of implementing new code once I had a good idea of what all of the previous code was used for.
